### ‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking Changes

  levels,
  now always returns `number`.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix `charts()` displaying bar funny when a user has infinity XP.
- Fix `convertFrom()` returning `NaN` when negative number is provided, now will return 0 by default.

- If `username` is specified in `addXP()`, `addLevel()`, `setLevel()`, it will update the user's username.
- Replaced `Baloo` font to re-add support for symbols, unfortunately this means increased package size.
- `charts()` and `leaderboardCard()` have attempted RAM usage improvements.

  leaks. [Issue #716](https://github.com/Brooooooklyn/canvas/issues/716)
